check the no of record coming for update and store their ids

get the record presnt in db and their ids

if incoming are more than in db 
            
    store records which have same ids as db ids - these are alredy prestn in db
    store records which have different ids than in db in a different container - not present in db

        then 
          use update query for the ones that are presnt in db and update
          use insert query to insert into db


if incoming are less than in db
    
    store record which have same ids as in db
       then
        use update query to update with matching ids
        use delete query to delete the ones which do not match the query
